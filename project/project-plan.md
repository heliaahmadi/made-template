# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Air Quality Analysis for Public Health

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How does the fluctuation in air quality metrics correlate with public health incidents in urban areas?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Air quality significantly impacts public health, particularly in densely populated urban environments. This project aims to analyze the correlation between air quality metrics (like PM10, NO2 levels) and the incidence of respiratory problems among the urban population. By using historical air quality data and health incident reports, the project seeks to identify patterns and potential causative relationships. The findings could provide insights for policymakers to enhance urban planning and health advisories.
