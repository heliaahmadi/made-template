# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Possible factors for climate change in London

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How do air quality, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions correlate with public health incidents in urban areas of London?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
This project aims to explore the relationships between air quality metrics, energy consumption levels, greenhouse gas emissions, and public health incidents in London. By integrating these diverse datasets, the study intends to uncover potential causative links between environmental factors and health outcomes. The insights derived could be invaluable for policymakers focused on improving urban planning and implementing effective health advisories to mitigate the impacts of environmental pollutants.
